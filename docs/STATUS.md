# Project Status & Resume Guide

_Last updated: 2026-07-03_

## TL;DR
- ✅ **Builds + links + runs** → `build-cmake/beetle-adventure-racing-recomp.exe` (native Windows, clang-cl, RT64/D3D12).
- ✅ **Plays** — boots through the intros/menus into races, **renders at 60 fps**, **keyboard input**
  works, and **audio plays**. The boot/menu pipeline (uv module overlay bridge, 78 modules, zero
  "Failed to find function"), VI, SI, RSP gfx + audio tasks all run.
- ✅ **Black screen FIXED** — it was a controller/SI `osRecvMesg` deadlock, not a gfx problem. Renders
  60 fps now. (Commit `b92a2cc`.)
- ✅ **Menu 60 fps** — was ~10 fps from an SI-queue requeue busy-spin; `requeue_si=false` (main.cpp:507).
- ✅ **Audio working** — RSP `aspMain` ucode wired; correct PCM transform (no-byteswap + channel-swap);
  latency + transition-crackle fixed (see WIP item 2 below).
- ✅ **Coventry Cove crash FIXED** — heap OOM; heap cap extended 4 MB → 8 MB (`fix-recompiled.sh` rule A).
- 🚧 **Current focus: polish.** Since 2026-06-30 the settings menu + Controls dialog + true in-game pause
  + render-res/MSAA/SSAA/divot seam fixes + letterbox controls all landed (see **[TODO.md](TODO.md)**). Of
  the original four WIP items, audio is done; **legal-screen skip, menu-transition flash, and track-map fps remain.**

## Frontend brought up to the reference port (2026-09-11)

The RecompFrontend build was rebuilt to match `wave-race-64-recomp`, this project's reference port.
Four things were wrong rather than merely different, and each was invisible in a screenshot:

1. **No gamepad worked.** `bar::input` built its device list from `SDL_CONTROLLERDEVICEADDED`, which
   recompinput's pump consumes and never forwards. Input now resolves through
   `recompinput::profiles::get_n64_input`, with a per-frame pad re-scan and automatic player
   assignment in connection order (`scripts/patch-recompinput.py`, mirroring the reference port).
2. **The Controls tab remapped nothing.** It writes `controls.json`, which only recompinput reads,
   while the game was resolved from `bar::input_config`'s own tables.
3. **Main Volume was inert**, as was rumble strength. Both are now applied.
4. **`NotoEmoji-Regular.ttf` was missing**, and recompui loads it unconditionally, so
   `Rml::LoadFontFace` failed at every startup. The whole Lato family is staged now.

**The pause screen's backdrop now covers the widened frame**, which took the inspector to find and
two new mechanisms to fix. It is orthographic geometry, so it never appeared in the rectangle list at
all; the port's own "the needle is the only orthographic projection in a race frame" rule was pinning
it to the left edge, where nothing could widen it; and once that was fixed per projection, `stretch`
still left BAR's overscan inset behind because the quad is drawn inset *within* the layer. Tagging
`ortho:5` and `ortho:7` with the new `cover` class closes it. Every projection is now listed and
taggable, not just orthographic ones.

Also: the launcher draws this project's icon as its background (`scripts/make-launcher-logo.py`),
the keyboard defaults are the ones this port documents rather than RecompFrontend's, there is a Mods
entry and a Quit entry, and a first run with no `graphics.json` starts fullscreen.

`bar::input` is **not** retired — it still owns the Controller Pak and is the whole input path in the
headless build. See [technical/05](technical/05-runtime-host.md#input-goes-through-recompinput).

**Both build directories had to be reconfigured**: they had been configured with `clang++` rather
than `clang-cl`, which appends `/W4` on a driver that does not accept it. That only fails when
something triggers a recompile, so it can sit latent for weeks.

## The HUD inspector — the F1 debug menu (2026-09-11)

Ported from `wave-race-64-recomp`. **F1** opens RT64's developer UI with a
**Beetle Adventure Racing HUD** window inside it: every 2D element of the current frame, with its
identity, extent and the class the classifier gave it; hover to outline it on screen, click to pin
the outline, and change its class from a dropdown that takes effect on the next frame. **Save to
hud.json** writes the result to `%LOCALAPPDATA%eetle-adventure-racing-recomp\hud.json`, which is
read at startup and applies with the panel off. Full guide: [HUD-INSPECTOR.md](HUD-INSPECTOR.md).

Three things changed underneath it:

* **Two new classes.** `stretch` (`G_EX_ASPECT_STRETCH`) and `spill` (lift the 4:3 scissor for one
  draw) join `center`/`left`/`right`. **Neither has a built-in user yet** — nothing in the positional
  heuristic returns them, so they only reach the renderer through a tag, and they should be treated
  as untested against real BAR elements until something has been tagged with each and looked at.
* **Tags work everywhere; the heuristic is still racing-only.** `classifyRect` now runs for every 2D
  rectangle rather than only during a race, because that is also what publishes the element list. The
  positional band heuristic is unchanged and still gated on `BarHud::racing()`, so **menus look
  exactly as before unless an element is explicitly tagged**.
* **RT64's developer mode is on unconditionally, and F2 is unbound.** Developer mode is what gates
  every path to the debug UI, and a debug menu that only exists in a build made for it is one nobody
  has when they need it. Turning it on also arms RT64's other shortcuts, and F2 toggles ray tracing
  for the session with nothing on screen to say so — the fork removes that case from both key
  filters. F3 (view RDRAM) and F4 (texture replacements) stay.

**The RT64 fork has uncommitted changes** (`lib/rt64`, branch `bar/hide-overscan-margins`):
`rt64_bar_hud.{h,cpp}`, `rt64_rdp.cpp`, `rt64_state.cpp`, `rt64_application.cpp`. They need
committing and pushing there before the submodule pointer here can move.

## Current WIP — polish items (2026-06-30)

Four issues were raised together; each was investigated with a verified multi-agent workflow. Status:

### 1. Legal/logo screen skip — 🚧 TODO (attract part done)
**Goal:** make the boot legal screens (Licensed by Nintendo, Electronic Arts, trademark/legal) **and**
the attract cinematics skippable by pressing **A / B / or Start** — *except* the first controller-pak /
"continue without saving" prompt, which must stay non-skippable.
- ✅ **Attract cinematics** already skip on A/B/Start: the game skips on START/A in
  `func_intro_004005CC`; we inject a B-button check after the `0x81D00618` input read
  (`fix-recompiled.sh` **rule D**, gated by `bar_intro_skip()` in `src/main/bar_config.cpp`).
- ❌ **Legal/logo screens NOT skippable yet.** They are driven by **un-decompiled boot assembly** whose
  per-frame handler hasn't been pinned down (`func_selection_004000E4`'s sub-handler is null during boot;
  the `logo` UVBT module didn't load in the boot trace; the legal text is likely uvFont-rendered by an
  un-found handler on a `uvClkGetSec` timer). The workflow agent for this item **failed** (hit the
  structured-output retry cap), so there is no lead yet.
- **Next:** recreate the in-process stack sampler (see memory `debug-build-run-loop`) to catch the active
  `func_*` during the EA/Nintendo screen, **or** instrument the 'game' module per-frame dispatch
  (`gGameExports->unk4`) to find the boot-screen driver, then add an A/B/Start check to its timer-advance.
  Keep the controller-pak prompt non-skippable.

### 2. Audio latency + clipping — ✅ DONE
- **Ever-growing latency** (audio played seconds behind the game): `osAiGetLength()` (`func_8000E460`,
  `src/main/hw_stubs.cpp`) was hard-stubbed to `0`, so the audio manager always thought the AI buffer was
  empty and synthesized the **max** samples every frame, flooding the unbounded SDL queue. **Fixed:** it
  now returns `ultramodern::get_remaining_audio_bytes()`. Queue is bounded; latency is small + constant.
- **Transition crackle** (underrun on every menu/state change): `func_uvcmidi_rom_00400940` stops the MIDI
  sequence player then **spins up to its 2.0 s timeout** waiting for the player to report stopped — but the
  player state only advances when the audio thread runs, which the cooperative scheduler couldn't do mid-
  spin. So it burned the full 2 s, starving audio. **Fixed:** inject `yield_self_1ms` into that loop
  (`fix-recompiled.sh` **rule E**).
- **General audio-thread starvation** during long game-thread compute (no preemption in the cooperative
  scheduler): **cooperative preemption** — a ~500 Hz host timer (`src/main/bar_preempt.cpp`) raises a
  "yield" flag; a one-line poll injected at every recompiled-function prologue (`fix-recompiled.sh`
  **rule F**) yields the App thread to the audio manager via `yield_self_1ms`. Gated to the **low-priority
  App thread only** (`ultramodern::this_thread_priority() < 100`) — yielding on the audio/scheduler threads
  themselves silenced audio and crashed; the priority gate fixes that. N64-correct; stable.
- **Buffer floor:** `buffer_offset_frames` default **2.5** (`ultramodern/src/audio.cpp`); ~1 VI (1.0) is too
  thin for glitch-free *desktop* audio (host OS + SDL device-callback jitter dip the queue regardless of the
  game-side fixes). Live-tunable with **`BAR_AUDIO_BUFFER`** (e.g. `=1.8`) to trade latency vs crackle.
- _Possible future latency win (untried): shrink the SDL device buffer (`want.samples`, currently 1024 ≈
  46 ms) in `bar_open_audio` — a separate latency lever from the queue offset._

### 3. Menu page-transition background flash — 🚧 TODO (workflow fix REFUTED)
**Symptom:** a one-frame flash in the background each time the menu slides to the next page.
- ⚠️ The workflow's proposed fix is **wrong — do NOT ship it.** Both adversarial reviewers refuted it: it
  rests on `func_selection_00418800` reading a UvGfxMgr export struct at `0x80025C74`, but that address is
  `gGameGuiExports` (the real gfx-mgr struct is `0x80025C08`). The recommended `func_uvgfxmgr_rom_00400F58`
  edit is outside the transition path and would risk a regression.
- **Directionally likely (unproven):** RT64 is HLE and reconstructs framebuffer-as-texture by RDRAM address;
  a 1-frame flash when the slide samples a just-written FB with **no tracked RT64 target yet** is a plausible
  class of bug.
- **Next:** re-decode `func_selection_00418800` (`funcs_5.c:2226-2312`) against the **real** callees
  (`gUvGuiExports->+0x70/74/78` = `uvgui_rom`; `gGameGuiExports->+0x14` = gamegui) to find which RDRAM
  address is captured as the slide source; capture (RT64 debug / RenderDoc) whether the slide's first frame
  samples an FB address with no tracked target. If so, the low-risk fix is RT64-side: in
  `lib/rt64/.../rt64_framebuffer_manager.cpp`, clear the reconstructed tile to transparent when there is
  genuinely no tracked target for the requested address (never when one exists — preserve real FB feedback).

### 4. Track-map preview animates choppy/low-fps — 🚧 TODO (needs one live trace)
**Symptom:** the spinning 3D track-map preview on the map-select screen animates at a low/glitchy frame rate
while the rest of the menu is smooth 60 fps.
- **Proven negatives (do not re-litigate):** it is **not** the whole-frame divider (`D_8001F7C0`,
  `funcs_45.c`), **not** renderer interpolation (off — `RefreshRate::Original`), and the time base
  `func_uvgfxmgr_rom_00401004()` is correct. The map-update site is in `selection.c` (100% GLOBAL_ASM),
  so the positive cause can't be read statically. Do NOT touch `speed_multiplier` / the VI clock.
- **Next (one decisive live experiment):** log per VI frame — (a) the map rotation angle, (b)
  `func_uvgfxmgr_rom_00401004()` real sec/frame, (c) a present-cadence timestamp; also read
  `D_uvgfxmgr_rom_00402480`. Classify → **Fix A** scale the per-tick step by real delta (idiom at
  `uvtseq_rom.c:243`, most likely), **Fix B** ungate an every-N update, **Fix C** drive the keyframe phase
  continuously, or it's a gfx-completion present-cadence stall. The fix lands in `RecompiledFuncs/` → it
  **must** be encoded as an address-keyed `fix-recompiled.sh` rule.

## What works
The full static-recompilation pipeline compiles end to end:

```
your ROM → BeetleDecomp `make recomp` → recomp.elf (133 module overlays)
        → N64Recomp → 22,406 functions (RecompiledFuncs/)
        → clang-cl + RT64 + librecomp/ultramodern → beetle-adventure-racing-recomp.exe
```

## Verified build environment (Windows)
- **VS Build Tools 2022** — `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools`
  (MSVC 14.42 + Win SDK 10.0.22621/26100). NB: the `C:\Program Files\…\BuildTools` dir is an empty shell.
- **LLVM clang-cl 22** — `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\clang-cl.exe` (`winget install LLVM.LLVM`).
- **CLion** — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\CLion` (its bundled CMake + Ninja are used).
- **N64Recomp** — built in WSL at `~/tools/N64Recomp`, checked out at **`ffb39cd`** (NOT `81213c1`).

## Reproduce the build (from a clean tree)
```bash
# 0. Dependencies (once)
git submodule update --init --recursive                 # in beetle-adventure-racing-recomp (RT64 contrib, etc.)
#    Install: VS Build Tools 2022 (Desktop C++ + Win SDK), LLVM (clang-cl), CLion.

# 1. Decomp -> per-module ELF (in WSL)
cd ~/projects/bar-decomp && source .venv/bin/activate && make recomp

# 2. Bring the ELF into the recomp repo
scripts/fetch-elf.sh                                     # -> elf/recomp.elf

# 3. Build N64Recomp @ ffb39cd (WSL) and recompile to C
#    git clone https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp ~/tools/N64Recomp
#    cd ~/tools/N64Recomp && git checkout ffb39cd && git submodule update --init --recursive
#    cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j6
~/tools/N64Recomp/build/N64Recomp beetle-adventure-racing-recomp.toml      # -> RecompiledFuncs/

# 4. REQUIRED post-gen fixup (the `lw $zero` codegen quirk)
scripts/fix-recompiled.sh

# 5. Configure + build (clang-cl + Ninja, from a VS env / x64 Native Tools prompt)
cmake -S . -B build-cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-cmake -j
# -> build-cmake/beetle-adventure-racing-recomp.exe (+ SDL2.dll, dxcompiler.dll, dxil.dll copied beside it)
```
Or open the folder in **CLion** (Toolchain = Visual Studio, C/C++ compiler = `clang-cl`, generator = Ninja).
See [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md).

## Fixes / workarounds applied (and why)
1. **UI off by default** (`-DBEETLE_ENABLE_UI=OFF`) — RmlUi requires Freetype (on Windows: add a
   `lib/freetype-windows-binaries` submodule). Off until the UI layer is wired.
2. **`__PRFCHWINTRIN_H` for `rt64`** — clang 22 treats `_m_prefetch` as a builtin, but RT64's
   vendored SDL2 2.26.3 also defines it (`SDL_endian.h`).
3. **`scripts/fix-recompiled.sh`** — N64Recomp emits `0 = MEM_W(...)` for `lw $zero` (invalid C);
   rewrite to `(void)MEM_W(...)`. **Re-run after every regeneration** (`RecompiledFuncs/` is git-ignored).
4. **`src/main/os_unimpl_stubs.cpp`** — no-op stubs for 9 low-level libultra OS functions that
   N64Recomp lists in `ignored_funcs`, `librecomp` doesn't provide, and BAR calls anyway:
   `__osViSwapContext`, `__osTimerInterrupt`, `__osSiGetAccess/RelAccess/RawStartDma`,
   `osPiReadIo`, `__osPiRawReadIo`, `__osPopThread`, `__osEnqueueThread`. **Link-only — NOT correct at runtime.**
5. **N64Recomp `ffb39cd`** — `81213c1` offloads libc (`memcpy`/`sprintf`/…) to a runtime that doesn't
   implement them; `ffb39cd` recompiles libc into `RecompiledFuncs`.
6. **`src/main/main.cpp`** — the not-yet-generated RSP audio ucode (`aspMain`) reference is neutralized.

## Done this session (2026-06-28 night) — boot now reaches BAR's module loader
- **RT64 render context** — `src/main/rt64_render_context.cpp` (adapted from Zelda64Recompiled,
  MIT): an `RT64::Application`-backed `RendererContext`. D3D12 init confirmed.
- **SDL window** — `create_gfx`/`create_window`/`update_gfx` in `main.cpp` open a real window and
  return the Win32 `WindowHandle{ HWND, thread_id }`. `SDL_MAIN_HANDLED` so our `main()` is used.
- **ROM identity** — `rom_hash = 0x56cfec69d7951f9fULL` (XXH3-64 of the z64), `internal_name =
  "Beetle Adventure Rac"` (20 bytes at ROM 0x20). Verified vs librecomp `check_hash`/`select_rom`.
- **Overlay table registered** — `src/main/register_overlays.cpp` includes `recomp_overlays.inl`
  and calls `recomp::overlays::register_overlays` (`num_code_sections = ARRLEN(section_table)`,
  `total_num_sections = num_sections (413)`).
- **ROM auto-start (no UI)** — `main()` does `select_rom` then a *deferred* `start_game` on a
  detached thread, gated on `g_bar_renderer_ready` (set by the RT64 factory) + 150 ms.
- **VI null-mode crash fixed** — the VI thread only seeds a dummy `OSViMode` while
  `!is_game_started()`; starting the game before the renderer/VI thread is up made `update_vi()`
  deref a null mode. The deferred start above fixes this.
- **`scripts/fix-recompiled.sh`** now also rewrites 218 empty reloc `.type` fields in
  `recomp_overlays.inl` → `R_MIPS_NONE` (raw ELF reloc types > N64Recomp's `reloc_names`; inert
  for base-game execution — the section reloc table is only read by the mod system).
- **CMake** — added the two new TUs, `RecompiledFuncs/` to the include path, RT64's include set
  via `$<TARGET_PROPERTY:rt64,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>`, and `BEETLE_DEBUGINFO` (ON) for `/Z7`+`/DEBUG`
  symbols on the boot-path targets (RT64 stays Release).

## Still stubbed / not done
- Most `os_unimpl_stubs.cpp` functions stay no-ops, but **`__osSiRawStartDma` now has real behavior**
  (posts the SI completion + writes a controller-read response into PIF RAM — this is what unblocked input
  and the black screen). Others (`__osViSwapContext`, `__osTimerInterrupt`, PI/thread-queue) remain no-ops.
- **Input:** ✅ keyboard **and** SDL controllers wired; a full **Controls dialog** (4-port config,
  rebinding, Rumble + Controller Paks, `input.json`) landed 2026-07-01 (`4b1f6f8`). Remaining: an
  in-game rebind/gameplay/save round-trip runtime test.
- **High-FPS / interpolation:** ✅ Phase 1 enabled + merged (`2277b32`) — interpolation on,
  `get_display_framerate` live, `enable_instant_present` wired. Remaining: Phase 2 (build throughput) +
  Phase 3 (artifact polish) — see [TODO.md](TODO.md) + [SETTINGS_MENU_AND_HIGH_FPS.md](SETTINGS_MENU_AND_HIGH_FPS.md).
- **Settings menu:** ✅ live (Tier-2 RmlUi over RT64) — Settings/Controls/Cheats/Pause pages, with render
  res + SSAA + MSAA + divot seam filter exposed. Remaining knobs to surface (FPS counter, audio
  buffer/device, mod manager) tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## How to build + run + debug (Windows, headless)
```bash
CMAKE="/c/Users/Bryan/AppData/Local/Programs/CLion/bin/cmake/win/x64/bin/cmake.exe"
"$CMAKE" -S . -B build-cmake          # clang-cl + Ninja are cached; clang-cl auto-detects MSVC
"$CMAKE" --build build-cmake -j
# Run (Release = /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS, so redirect to see logs):
cd build-cmake && ./beetle-adventure-racing-recomp.exe >run.log 2>&1   # ROM path: argv[1], else hardcoded Downloads path
# Symbolized backtrace at a crash:
"/c/Program Files/LLVM/bin/lldb.exe" --batch -o run -o bt -o quit -- ./beetle-adventure-racing-recomp.exe
```

## ✅ DONE: the uv module overlay CODE bridge
`src/main/overlay_bridge.cpp` owns the `uvDoModuleRelocs` symbol (the generated definition is
renamed to `uvDoModuleRelocs_orig` by `fix-recompiled.sh`). On each module load it reads the
4-char `nameTag` from `ModuleCommInfo` (a1+0x1C), maps it to the overlay id via a 133-entry
`nameTag -> overlay_id` table (overlays.us.txt order; tags from the decomp's
`tools/daisybox/src/bar_module_files.c`), then `unload_overlay_by_id` + `load_overlay_by_id(id,
ovlStartPtr)` and runs `uvDoModuleRelocs_orig`. Result: 57+ modules register, `func_map` resolves,
recompiled module code runs. (Also: VI null-mode race fixed via `g_bar_vi_ticked` gate. The RSP audio
task `aspMain` is now wired in `get_rsp_microcode` — no longer stubbed; and `hw_stubs.cpp`'s AI-length read
now returns the real queued length, not 0 — see WIP item 2.)

## ✅ RESOLVED: black screen (was a controller/SI deadlock, not gfx)
The "no `M_GFXTASK` submitted" symptom was downstream of a **controller (SI) `osRecvMesg` deadlock**:
BAR drives the controller through the low-level libultra path (`__osSiRawStartDma`), which our runtime
stubbed — so the game blocked forever waiting for an SI-complete event and never reached its render. **Fix**
(`src/main/os_unimpl_stubs.cpp`, commit `b92a2cc`): `__osSiRawStartDma_recomp` posts the SI completion
(`ultramodern::send_si_message()`) and writes a real controller-read response into PIF RAM. Also forced
`__osMaxControllers` to 4 (`fix-recompiled.sh` rule B) so a `READ_BUTTON` command is actually packed. The
game now renders at 60 fps and reads keyboard input.

## Visual verification — standard practice
**To see what's on screen, capture RT64's internal render — never a window-manager screenshot.** RT64's
present is read back GPU→PNG headlessly (no window focus needed), so it's the ground truth and works in
CI/background runs. Standard tools (all in **[HEADLESS_TESTING.md](HEADLESS_TESTING.md)**):
- `BAR_SHOTS="frame:path …"` — capture at scripted input frames (aligned with `BAR_AUTOPLAY`).
- `BAR_SHOT_BURST="fc:dir:count"` — record N consecutive presents to `dir/fNNNN.png` for **animations**
  the input timeline can't sample (e.g. the film-roll, where the game blocks in a render loop).
- `RT64_SHOT_TRIGGER`/`RT64_SHOT_OUT` — ad-hoc file-triggered single capture.

Combine with `BAR_SKIP_LAUNCHER=1` + `BAR_AUTOPLAY` to drive the game to any screen and capture it. Don't
assume where you are — capture and look (see memory `verify-on-the-actual-screen`).

## Common diagnostic env flags
`BAR_FPS` (fps counter) · `BAR_NO_AUDIO` (disable audio) · `BAR_AUDIO_DBG` (queue min/max + underrun + peak/
clip) · `BAR_AUDIO_BUFFER=<vi>` (audio buffer depth, default 2.5) · `BAR_AUDIO_XFORM` / `BAR_AUDIO_CAPTURE`
(PCM transform / capture) · `BAR_DEBUG_OVERLAYS` (log module loads) · `BAR_NO_INTRO_SKIP` (disable A/B/Start
intro skip) · `BAR_AUTOPLAY="frames:hexbtn …"` (scripted input: A=8000 B=4000 START=1000 UP=0800) ·
`BAR_FORCESTATE="frame:state …"` (force `gGameSettings->gameStateFlag`) · `BAR_PRESENT_MODE=console|skip|early`
(RT64 present mode; default **console** = present from the VI origin, so VI-origin menu transitions like the
film-roll animate cleanly with no pre-pan flash. `skip`=SkipBuffering, `early`=PresentEarly/min-latency) ·
`BAR_INSTANT_PRESENT` (legacy alias for `early`).

## Remaining roadmap (after the current polish items)

> The forward-looking checklist now lives in **[TODO.md](TODO.md)** (consolidated todolist,
> including the 7 priorities raised 2026-06-30). The summary below is kept for context.

- **Polish items 1/3/4** above (legal-screen skip, menu-transition flash, track-map fps) — still open.
- **High-FPS Phase 2/3** — Phase 1 is merged/active; throughput (`/GL`+`/LTCG`, thread priority) +
  interpolation artifact polish remain.
- **Settings menu** — live; remaining knobs to surface: on-screen FPS counter, audio buffer/device, mod manager.
- Per-game F3DEX2 rendering quirks as they surface.

## Tooling note: N64Recomp builds on Windows now
`lib/N64Recomp` (already at `ffb39cd`) builds with clang-cl + CLion's cmake/ninja →
`lib/N64Recomp/build-win/N64Recomp.exe` (pass `-DCMAKE_RC_COMPILER` to a Win SDK `rc.exe`). WSL is
unusable for it (gcc 9.4, no cmake, sudo needs a password). Regen isn't needed for threading —
N64Recomp's built-in symbol lists already defer libultra OS funcs to ultramodern.

## Key references
- Git history: `f92cdb0` (fixup script), `890a87f` (build green), `cfec695` (overlays wired).
- `recomp.elf` comes from **bryankruman/BeetleDecomp** `make recomp` (`tools/genRecompLd.py`,
  `MODULE_VRAM_BASE = 0x80800000`).
- Upstream patterns to adapt: Zelda64Recompiled (`src/main`, `CMakeLists.txt`),
  N64ModernRuntime (`librecomp`, `ultramodern`).
